Assignment Details:
Use BlueJ to write a Java program whose main() takes an int
via the command line arguments and prints out the corresponding
number of rows of Pascal's triangle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's_triangle.
This should use a method pascalRow() which takes an int for the row number and returns
a String of the corresponding row. Each entry can be computed via the binomial coefficient,
and you can import a method from this from org.apache.commons.numbers.combinatorics.BinomialCoefficient
